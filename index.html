	<textarea name="" id="input_text" cols="30" rows="10">A pangram, or holoalphabetic sentence, is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. The most famous pangram is probably the thirtyfive letter-long "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," which has been used to test typing equipment since at least the late. Pangrams are an important tool for testing typing equipment and compactly showing off every letter of a typeface; trying to pack every letter into as short a sentence as possible is also a sort of sport among linguists and puzzle-solvers.</textarea>
